##baseline_Xclip_1

AG-a baseline base on Xlip and clip

this method's mAP on AG is 0.08%

We think there was an error in the method of calculating the mAP

##shuning-q2l

AG-a baseline base on query2label --Completely follow the processing method of query2label

From the results, it can be seen that there are still areas where this model has not been adjusted

##baseline_Xclip_4.22

we notice that now we detect on AG's frame level so we change the vison_encoder from xclip to clip

this method can reach mAP on all dataset to over 23%
